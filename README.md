# Computational modelling of behavioural data

Author: Akira Ishiyama

This is a repo for the individual project of the module 'Computational Cognitive Neuroscience".

The report is on modelling behavioural impairments during a probabilistic reversal learning task, inspired by an experiment carried out by Andrea D’Olimpio for his Master by Research in the Series’ Lab.

It explores whether anxiety leads people to differ in how they learn to predict adverse events in the future.

The Jupyter Notebook contains python codes that were written to simulate the neural model.
